    1. Give the conversation in a detailed dialog format after cleaning up the transcript. maintain the depth of the conversation and the details.
    2. **Maintain factual accuracy** â€“ Ensure that all important values, statistics, and statements remain intact.

    ### Guidelines:
    - Retain core messages and any critical data shared in the conversation.
    - Use a clear and natural writing style.
    - The output should contain **only plain text**, with no symbols, special formatting, or structured elements like key points.
